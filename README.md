# notion-mangas-collection-bot
A bot that updates automatically informations about manga series in your Notion collection manager.

However, feel free to fork and adapt the project for your zone ;)

- Auto-updates the last volume number released for each manga
- Auto-updates the next volume date release for each manga with volume title
- Auto-checks if your collection is full or not

- Uses 'Loggy', a bot that allows you to receive notifications in your personnal discord servers when there is new data in your notion db
